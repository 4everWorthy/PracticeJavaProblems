/** We need to remove a character from a string.
 * This character will be represented by an index number, similar to an index in an array.
 * First, we'll break the string into two parts:
 * one part before the character that is being removed, and the second part after the removed character.
 * After removing the character, we'll combine the remaining characters into a single string output.
